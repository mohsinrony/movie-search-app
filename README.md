# TypeScript Project: Movie Search App

A movie search app is an entertaining project idea that allows users to search for movies and view information like ratings, plot summaries, and posters. You can fetch movie data from an API, such as OMDb or The Movie Database (TMDb).

## To build a movie search app, you'll need to:

    - Implement a user interface for searching for movies and displaying results.
    - Fetch movie data from a movie API.
    - Display movie information, such as title, release date, rating, and poster.
    - Enable users to filter or sort search results by criteria like release date or rating.
